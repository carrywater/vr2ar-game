# AR-VR Switching in Digital Games

## Project Overview

This repository contains a university project focused on the seamless integration and switching between Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) in digital games. Our project, a game developed through a research-through-design approach, explores the unique capabilities of both AR and VR, creating a mixed reality experience that leverages the strengths of each medium.

### Game Concept

The game places the player in the first-person perspective of a robot mouse on a mission to gather as much cheese as possible and stash it in its hiding hole. The house is inhabited by rogue individuals that the mouse must avoid. The innovative switching mechanism between AR and VR offers a god-like perspective for real-time information, planning, and interaction, dynamically influencing the VR environment.

### Key features:

This project includes several features that can be useful for other creators looking to develop similar AR-VR experiences:

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **House Model** | Fully custom low-poly house model with assets suitable for both AR and VR. |
| **VR to AR Setup in Unreal Engine 5.3.2** | A working setup demonstrating the transition between VR and AR within Unreal Engine 5.3.2. |
| **Custom VR Pawn Movement** | Smooth VR movement that minimizes feeling of nausea. |
| **Enemy Pawn Sensing NPC** | A scalable non-player character blueprint (NPC) with advanced behavior states including passive, investigating, seeking, and attacking. |
| **Damage System** | A system that handles damage, health, and healing taken by the player character from enemies or obstacles. |
| **Collectable System** | A system for collectable items, including logic for collecting and tracking progress. |
## Background and Motivation

### Progression of VR and AR

VR and AR technologies have made significant strides in recent years, offering immersive and interactive experiences in various fields, including gaming. VR provides fully immersive environments, while AR overlays digital content onto the real world, enhancing the user's perception and interaction with their surroundings.

### Mixed Reality Possibilities

Mixed reality (MR) experiences combine the best of both VR and AR, creating new possibilities for digital interaction. For example, games can now take place in familiar real-world settings, such as your home, blending physical and digital elements in a cohesive experience.

## Research Goals

Our project aimed to:

1. **Explore the intrinsic qualities of AR and VR**: Understand how each medium can contribute uniquely to gameplay.
2. **Facilitate frictionless switching**: Develop methods for seamless transitions between AR and VR.
3. **Extrapolate design knowledge**: Gain insights into designing mixed reality experiences that enhance player engagement and immersion.

## Gameplay Mechanics

- **Collecting Cheese**: Navigate through the house, gather cheese, and avoid rogue individuals.
- **Hiding Hole**: Stash collected cheese in the mouse's hiding hole.
- **AR Perspective**: Switch to AR for a top-down view of the house, allowing for strategic planning and interaction.
- **VR Perspective**: Return to the immersive first-person VR perspective to execute your plans and react to the environment.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/carrywater/vr2ar_final.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd vr2ar_final`
3. Follow the setup instructions in the `INSTALL.md` (COMING SOON)
   
## Usage

1. Launch the game using the provided startup script or through your preferred development environment.
2. Use the controls documented in the `USER_MANUAL.md` (COMING SOON) to navigate and switch between AR and VR perspectives and change the switching mechanic.
3. Collect cheese, avoid rogue individuals, and strategize using the AR perspective to enhance your gameplay.
